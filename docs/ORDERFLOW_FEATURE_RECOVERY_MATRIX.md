# Orderflow Feature Recovery Matrix

Post-fusion regression recovery — restoring the full orderflow cockpit feature set inside the single Lightweight-based execution chart.

## Runtime Health Separation

After fusion, trade stream health and order book health were incorrectly mixed in the UI:
- "No trades received — data may be stale" appeared when the order book had sync issues
- Order book errors (DEGRADED, SNAPSHOT_LOADING) leaked into trade stream alerts

**Fix**: Trade health and book health are now fully separate:
- `tradeError` — only trade stream issues (aggTrade WebSocket)
- `orderBookHealth` + `orderBookError` — only book sync issues
- ConnectionStatus shows each stream independently
- Toolbar only shows trade/ticker errors (book shown in ConnectionStatus)

## Bubble Rendering

Bubbles depend on aggTrade data, NOT order book health:
- Bubbles draw even if book is SNAPSHOT_LOADING or DEGRADED
- Bubbles are created from trades with notional > $5000 (BTC)
- CLUSTERED mode falls back to RAW if no cluster data exists
- Overlay canvas has explicit z-index (10) to render above Lightweight Charts

| Footprint cells | ✅ YES | `drawFootprint()` — per-candle price-level delta with zoom threshold | `executionOverlayRenderer.ts` | None |
| Delta display | ✅ YES | `+1.2k` / `-3.5k` labels in footprint cells | `executionOverlayRenderer.ts` | None |
| Footprint zoom threshold | ✅ YES | Hidden when `slotWidth < 12` | `executionOverlayRenderer.ts` | None |

| Symbol switch clears state | ✅ YES | `getDataResetFields()` in `marketStore.ts` | `marketStore.ts` | None |
| Order book health states | ✅ YES | HEALTHY, DEGRADED, RESYNCING, STALE, ERROR, DISCONNECTED | `marketStore.ts` + overlay | None |
| Toolbar controls | ✅ YES | Symbol, interval, bubble mode (RAW/CLU/HYB), nav, view | `Toolbar.tsx` | None |

| No WebSockets in chart | ✅ YES | Zero WebSocket calls in chart/overlay files | `ExecutionChart.tsx` | None |
| Build passes | ✅ YES | `tsc && vite build` — 0 errors | Build output | None |

## Notes

- **Bubble percentile sizing** was missing after fusion — old renderer computed per-candle notional percentiles and passed them to `getBubbleVisualStyle()`. Restored in recovery.
- **Heatmap range filtering** was missing — old renderer filtered by 2% price range. Restored with fallback.
- **Heatmap quantity labels** showed actual quantities (e.g., "BID 1.2k") — post-fusion only showed "BID LIQ". Restored.
- **Cluster tooltips** were not implemented — added with trade count, VWAP, flow type, absorption score.
- **Spread line** was not in old renderer either — added as improvement.
- **State dimming** for non-HEALTHY orderbook states was missing from heatmap — restored.
